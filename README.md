# Economic Python: Enhanced CS50 Introduction to Programming

## Overview

This project is an enhanced version of Harvard's [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python] (https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) course materials (except the data structure and plots), specifically tailored for economics and business studies students. Created by Md. Siddiqur Rahman, M.Sc. in Economics, Jahangirjagur University, these notebooks provide comprehensive Python programming education with economic context, examples, and applications.

## About This Project

This collection of Jupyter notebooks enhances the original CS50 Python course materials by:

- Adding economic context and real-world examples relevant to economics and business
- Incorporating examples using Bangladesh's economic data where appropriate
- Providing detailed explanations of programming concepts with economic applications
- Including additional practice problems with economic themes
- Offering comprehensive documentation for better understanding

- Familiarity with economic indicators and data (GDP, inflation, etc.) is beneficial

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Standard Python libraries (included in Python)
- Additional libraries for specific notebooks (matplotlib, pandas, etc.)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tushar-Siddik/cs50-python-economics.git
   cd cs50-python-economics
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

## How to Use These Notebooks

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and can be used independently or as part of the complete course. Here's how to get the most out of them:

1. **Sequential Learning**: Start with Lecture 0 and progress through each lecture in order
2. **Active Participation**: Run the code cells, modify them, and experiment with different values
3. **Practice Problems**: Complete the practice problems at the end of each notebook
4. **Economic Applications**: Pay special attention to the economic examples and try to relate them to your field of study

## Course Structure

Each lecture notebook follows this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the programming concepts and their economic applications
2. **Concept Explanation**: Detailed explanation of programming concepts
3. **Simple Examples**: Basic examples to understand the concept
4. **Economic Examples**: Real-world economic applications
5. **Practice Problems**: Problems to test your understanding
6. **Solutions**: Detailed solutions to the practice problems

## Economic Context

Throughout these notebooks, you'll find:

- Examples using Bangladesh's economic data
- Applications relevant to economic analysis
- Business case studies
- Financial modeling examples
- Market analysis applications
