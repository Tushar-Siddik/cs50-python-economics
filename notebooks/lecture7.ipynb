    "## **Lecture 7: Regular Expressions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our exploration of Regular Expressions (regex)! This notebook is based on the seventh lecture of CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python, taught by David J. Malan. We'll dive into the powerful world of pattern matching in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Regular Expressions Matter for Economists**\n",
    "In economics, you often need to:\n",
    "- **Extract Economic Data:** Parse economic reports to extract specific figures, dates, and indicators\n",
    "- **Process Survey Data:** Clean and standardize text responses from economic surveys\n",
    "- **Analyze Financial Documents:** Extract information from financial statements and reports\n",
    "- **Filter Economic News:** Identify relevant economic news from large text corpora\n",
    "- **Validate Economic Inputs:** Ensure user input follows expected economic data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions provide a powerful way to search, extract, and manipulate text data, making them invaluable for economic text analysis.\n",

    "A **regular expression** (regex) is a pattern that specifies a set of strings. In Python, we use the `re` module to work with regular expressions. Regular expressions are incredibly useful for:\n",
    "- Validating input (like email addresses)\n",
    "- Extracting specific data from text\n",
    "- Replacing parts of strings\n",
    "- Splitting strings based on patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Economic Context\n",
    "In economics, regular expressions are like specialized search tools for text data. Just as economists use statistical methods to identify patterns in numerical data, regular expressions help identify patterns in text data. For example, you might use regex to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract all monetary values from an economic report\n",
    "- Find all dates in a specific format within a document\n",
    "- Identify and standardize country names in a dataset\n",
    "- Extract economic indicators from news articles\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored the powerful world of regular expressions in Python. We've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic regex patterns and special characters\n",
    "2. How to use anchors and boundaries\n",
    "3. Character classes and their shorthands\n",
    "4. Regex flags to modify behavior\n",
    "5. How to extract data using groups\n",
    "6. Applied these concepts to solve real-world problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Applications of Regular Expressions\n",
    "Regular expressions are fundamental to modern economic text analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Extraction:** Extracting economic indicators, dates, and monetary values from reports and news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Standardization:** Cleaning and standardizing economic data from different sources with varying formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Content Analysis:** Identifying key economic terms, themes, and patterns in large text corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Survey Processing:** Parsing and validating responses from economic surveys with text answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Financial Document Analysis:** Extracting specific information from financial statements and reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Economic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start Simple:** Begin with basic patterns and gradually add complexity as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Thoroughly:** Create comprehensive tests for your regex patterns, especially with economic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Patterns:** Document what your regex patterns are designed to match and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handle Edge Cases:** Consider unusual formats or edge cases in economic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Named Groups:** For complex patterns, use named groups to improve code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are a fundamental tool in text processing and data validation. While they can seem complex at first, they become more intuitive with practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to refer to the Python `re` module documentation when you need to craft more complex patterns!"
