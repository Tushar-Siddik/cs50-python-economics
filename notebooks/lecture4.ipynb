    "## **Lecture 4: Libraries, Modules, and APIs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Lecture 4 of CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python! This notebook is an enhanced version of CS50's lecture on libraries, modules, and APIs, tailored specifically for you as an Economics graduate from Jahangirnagar University. Understanding how to leverage existing code libraries and interact with APIs is crucial for economic analysis and data science.\n",

    "### **Why Libraries and APIs Matter for Economists**\n",
    "In economics, you often need to:\n",
    "- **Analyze Data:** Use specialized libraries for statistical analysis and visualization\n",
    "- **Fetch Economic Data:** Access real-time economic indicators from APIs\n",
    "- **Perform Calculations:** Use mathematical libraries for complex economic modeling\n",
    "- **Build Applications:** Create tools that interact with external economic data sources\n",

    "## 1. Introduction to Libraries and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "A **library** (or **module**) is a collection of pre-written code that you can use in your own programs. Libraries help promote code reusability and allow you to stand on the shoulders of others who have already solved problems you might be facing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with many built-in modules, and there are thousands of third-party modules available through the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a module in your program, you need to **import** it using the `import` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Context: Why Libraries Matter for Economists\n",
    "In economic analysis, libraries are essential for:\n",
    "- **Statistical Analysis:** Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and StatsModels provide tools for economic data analysis\n",
    "- **Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn help create economic charts and graphs\n",
    "- **Data Collection:** Requests and BeautifulSoup enable fetching economic data from websites\n",
    "- **Mathematical Modeling:** SciPy offers advanced mathematical functions for economic modeling\n",
    "- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn provides tools for economic forecasting and pattern recognition"

    "In this problem, you'll implement a math quiz program similar to the Little Professor toy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a program in a file called `professor.py` that:\n",
    "1. Prompts the user for a level, n. If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.\n",
    "2. Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y =, where each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with n digits.\n",
    "3. Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct (or not a number), the program should output EEE and prompt again, allowing up to three tries in total.\n",
    "4. If the user has not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.\n",
    "5. The program should output the user's score: the number of correct answers out of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints\n",
    "- Use the provided structure with `get_level()` and `generate_integer(level)` functions\n",
    "- Use `random.randint()` to generate random numbers\n",
    "- Use a nested loop structure: outer loop for the 10 problems, inner loop for the 3 tries\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we've explored the power of Python's libraries and modules, which allow us to extend Python's functionality and reuse code. We've learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import and use built-in modules like `random`, `statistics`, and `sys`\n",
    "- Handle command-line arguments and errors\n",
    "- Use list slices to work with subsets of data\n",
    "- Install and use third-party packages from PyPI\n",
    "- Make API requests and work with JSON data\n",
    "- Create our own modules for code reusability\n",

    "### Economic Applications of Libraries and APIs\n",
    "Libraries and APIs are fundamental to modern economic programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Analysis:** Libraries like Pandas and NumPy provide powerful tools for economic data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-time Data:** APIs allow access to current economic indicators and financial market data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualization:** Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn enable creation of economic charts and graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Statistical Modeling:** StatsModels and Scikit-learn provide tools for econometric analysis and forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Automation:** Command-line tools can automate economic data processing and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are fundamental to building more complex and powerful Python programs. By leveraging existing libraries and creating your own, you can write more efficient, organized, and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem sets in this lecture have given you hands-on experience with these concepts, from working with emoji and ASCII art to creating interactive games and querying real-world APIs. These skills will serve you well as you continue your journey in Python programming."
