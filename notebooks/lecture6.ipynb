    "Welcome to Lecture 6 of CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python! In this notebook, we'll explore how to work with files in Python, including reading from and writing to files, handling CSV data, and working with images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why File I/O Matters for Economists**\n",
    "In economics, you often need to:\n",
    "- **Analyze Economic Data:** Read data from CSV files containing economic indicators\n",
    "- **Store Research Results:** Save your analysis results for future reference\n",
    "- **Process Large Datasets:** Work with files that are too large to fit in memory\n",
    "- **Automate Data Collection:** Save data from APIs or web scraping to files\n",
    "- **Create Reports:** Generate formatted reports from your economic analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "File I/O allows you to persistently store and retrieve data, making it possible to build sophisticated economic analysis tools.\n",

    "Up until now, most of our programs have stored information in memory, which is lost when the program exits. **File I/O** (Input/Output) allows us to store data persistently on disk, so it can be accessed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files can be used for:\n",
    "- Storing user input between program runs\n",
    "- Reading configuration settings\n",
    "- Processing data from other applications\n",
    "- Saving results for later analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the `open()` function to work with files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Economic Application\n",
    "In economics research, you'll frequently work with data files containing:\n",
    "- Time series data (GDP, inflation, unemployment rates over time)\n",
    "- Cross-sectional data (economic indicators across countries or regions)\n",
    "- Panel data (combination of time series and cross-sectional)\n",
    "- Survey results and experimental data\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to read, process, and write these files is essential for economic analysis."

    "In this lecture, we've explored the fundamentals of File I/O in Python, which allows us to store and retrieve data persistently. We've learned how to:\n",

    "- Read from and write to text files\n",
    "- Use the `with` statement for automatic file handling\n",
    "- Work with CSV files using the `csv` module\n",
    "- Process and transform data from one format to another\n",

    "### Economic Applications of File I/O\n",
    "File I/O is fundamental to modern economic analysis and research:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Analysis:** Reading economic data from CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or databases for statistical analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time Series Analysis:** Working with historical economic data stored in files to identify trends, cycles, and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Economic Modeling:** Saving and loading model parameters, results, and intermediate calculations for complex economic simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Report Generation:** Creating formatted reports and visualizations from economic analysis results for policymakers and stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Collection:** Automating the collection and storage of economic data from APIs, web scraping, or other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Reproducible Research:** Ensuring economic research is reproducible by properly documenting and storing data, code, and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Economic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always Use Context Managers:** Use `with` statements to ensure files are properly closed, even when errors occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validate Economic Data:** Implement checks to ensure economic data is reasonable (e.g., GDP values are positive, percentages are between 0-100).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Data Sources:** Include metadata in your files about where economic data comes from, when it was collected, and any transformations applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handle Missing Values:** Economic data often has missing values; implement strategies to handle them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backup Important Data:** Economic data can be valuable and irreplaceable; implement backup strategies for important datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem sets in this lecture have given you hands-on experience with various file operations, from counting lines of code to processing CSV data and manipulating images. These practical skills will serve you well in your future programming endeavors."
