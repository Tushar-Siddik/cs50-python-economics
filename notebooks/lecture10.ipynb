    "A **linked list** is a linear data structure made up of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists don't store elements in contiguous memory locations, which makes them more flexible for certain operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties of Linked Lists:**\n",
    "- **Node-Based Structure:** Made up of individual nodes linked together\n",
    "- **Dynamic Size:** Can grow or shrink easily\n",
    "- **Efficient Insertion/Deletion:** Adding or removing elements is efficient\n",
    "- **Sequential Access:** Elements must be accessed in order\n",
    "- **Memory Overhead:** Requires extra memory for pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Linked Lists:**\n",
    "- **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node\n",
    "- **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points to both the next and previous nodes\n",
    "- **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic Applications:**\n",
    "- Implementing dynamic economic data structures\n",
    "- Managing transaction histories that grow over time\n",

    "A **tree** is a non-linear hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Trees are particularly useful in economics for representing hierarchical relationships like organizational structures, taxonomies, or decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties of Trees:**\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Structure:** Nodes are arranged in a hierarchy\n",
    "- **Root Node:** The topmost node in the tree\n",
    "- **Parent/Child Relationships:** Each node (except root) has exactly one parent\n",
    "- **Leaf Nodes:** Nodes with no children\n",
    "- **Levels:** Root is at level 0, its children at level 1, and so on\n",
    "- **Height:** The length of the longest path from root to a leaf\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Trees:**\n",
    "- **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children\n",
    "- **Binary Search Tree:** Ordered binary tree for efficient searching\n",
    "- **AVL Tree:** Self-balancing binary search tree\n",
    "- **B-Tree:** Generalized tree for disk-based storage\n",
    "- **Trie:** Tree for storing strings efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic Applications:**\n",
    "- Representing organizational hierarchies in companies\n",
    "- Building decision trees for economic decisions\n",
    "- Creating taxonomies for economic classifications\n",

    "As an Economics graduate, you often need to organize and analyze economic data efficiently. This problem will test your understanding of basic data structures and their applications in economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Implement a system to organize and analyze economic data for multiple countries. The system should allow users to add, update, and analyze economic indicators for different countries using appropriate data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "1. Create a class `Country` to represent a country with its economic data\n",
    "2. Implement methods to add and update economic indicators\n",
    "3. Create a class `WorldEconomy` to manage multiple countries\n",
    "4. Implement methods to analyze and compare economic data across countries\n",
    "5. Use appropriate data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.) for efficient operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Use dictionaries to store economic indicators by name\n",
    "- Use lists to store time-series data\n",
    "- Consider using sets for operations like finding common indicators\n",
    "- Implement appropriate methods for data analysis and comparison"

    "## Problem Set 2: Market Network Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As an Economics graduate, you often need to analyze market networks and relationships between different economic entities. Graphs are particularly useful for this type of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Implement a system to analyze market networks using graph data structures. The system should allow users to model economic relationships, analyze network properties, and identify key entities in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "1. Create a class `MarketNetwork` that extends the graph data structure\n",
    "2. Implement methods to add and remove entities and relationships\n",
    "3. Implement methods to analyze network properties (centrality, connectivity, etc.)\n",
    "4. Implement methods to identify key entities in the network\n",
    "5. Use appropriate graph algorithms for economic analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Use adjacency lists to represent the graph\n",
    "- Implement centrality measures to identify important entities\n",
    "- Consider using shortest path algorithms for connectivity analysis\n",
    "- Implement methods to find clusters or communities in the network"

    "## Problem Set 3: Economic Model Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "As an Economics graduate, you often need to implement and analyze economic models. This problem will test your ability to create custom data structures for economic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Implement a system for economic modeling using custom data structures. The system should allow users to define economic models, set parameters, run simulations, and analyze results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "1. Create a base class `EconomicModel` with common functionality\n",
    "2. Implement at least two specific economic models (e.g., IS-LM, Solow Growth)\n",
    "3. Create a class `ModelComparison` to compare different models\n",
    "4. Implement methods to run simulations and analyze results\n",
    "5. Use appropriate data structures to store and analyze model results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Use dictionaries to store model parameters and variables\n",
    "- Implement methods to calculate equilibrium and dynamics\n",
    "- Consider using lists or data frames to store simulation results\n",
    "- Implement visualization methods for model results"
