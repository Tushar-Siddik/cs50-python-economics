    "# The History and Evolution of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Origins and Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands (CWI). Van Rossum began working on Python as a hobby project during his Christmas break in 1989, inspired by the ABC programming language and Modula-3. He wanted to create a language that was both powerful and easy to read, with a focus on code readability and syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages like C++ or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name \"Python\" was not derived from the snake but from the British comedy series \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" of which Van Rossum was a big fan. Python 0.9.0, the first public release, was made in February 1991."

    "\n",
    "### What is Programming?\n",
    "At its core, programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to execute. Programming is the art of instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. Think of it like creating a very detailed recipe. You, the chef (programmer), write a recipe (program) that tells your kitchen assistant (the computer) exactly how to prepare a dish (perform a task).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Vocabulary\n",
    "- **Code:** The actual text of the instructions, written in a programming language like Python.\n",
    "- **Function:** A named block of code that performs a specific, reusable action. Think of it as a verb. Examples: `print`, `input`, `calculate_gdp`.\n",
    "- **Argument:** A value you provide to a function to influence its behavior. Think of it as the noun or object the verb acts upon.\n",
    "- **Variable:** A named container for storing a value. Like a labeled box where you can keep information. Example: `inflation_rate = 0.06`.\n",
    "- **String:** A sequence of text, like \"Siddiqur\" or \"Jahangirnagar University\". Always enclosed in quotes.\n",
    "- **Bug:** An error or mistake in your code that causes it to behave unexpectedly. Finding and fixing bugs is a core part of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It's widely used in various fields including:\n",
    "- Data analysis (perfect for Economics!)\n",
    "- Web development\n",
    "- Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "- Scientific computing\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python Interpreter\n",
    "The Python program that reads and executes your code is called the **interpreter**. It reads your script line by line and carries out the instructions. In this Jupyter Notebook, the interpreter runs each code cell when you execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "To run Python code, you need:\n",
    "1. Python interpreter (the program that executes Python code)\n",
    "2. A text editor or IDE (like VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use Jupyter Notebook which allows us to write and execute Python code in cells."
