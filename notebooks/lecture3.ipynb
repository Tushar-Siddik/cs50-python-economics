    "Welcome to your third lecture in CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python! This notebook is based on the third lecture, taught by David J. Malan. We'll explore how to handle errors and unexpected situations in your code through exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Exception Handling Matters for Economists**\n",
    "In economics, you often work with:\n",
    "- **Real-world Data:** Economic datasets frequently contain missing values, outliers, or formatting errors\n",
    "- **User Input:** Building economic models that require user input, which might be invalid\n",
    "- **External Data Sources:** Fetching data from APIs or files that might be unavailable or corrupted\n",
    "- **Mathematical Operations:** Performing calculations that might result in errors (division by zero, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling allows your programs to gracefully handle these situations without crashing, making your economic analysis tools more reliable and user-friendly.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction to Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, exceptions refer to problems that occur during the execution of a program. When something is \"exceptional\" in your program, it doesn't mean it's good—it means something has gone wrong that you need to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of exceptions in economics like unexpected market events. Just as economists need contingency plans for market crashes, programmers need to handle exceptions to prevent their programs from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept:** An **exception** is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is disrupted, and the program terminates unless the exception is handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Context: Why Exceptions Matter\n",
    "In economic analysis, exceptions can occur in many scenarios:\n",
    "- **Data Validation:** When economic data doesn't meet expected formats or ranges\n",
    "- **Mathematical Operations:** When calculations result in errors (e.g., division by zero in economic ratios)\n",
    "- **File Operations:** When data files are missing or corrupted\n",
    "- **API Calls:** When economic data sources are unavailable\n",
    "- **User Input:** When users provide invalid values for economic parameters"

    "## 12. Best Practices for Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we've explored exception handling in Python, which is a crucial skill for writing robust and reliable programs. Here are the key takeaways and best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Concepts**\n",
    "1. **Exceptions** are errors that occur during program execution.\n",
    "2. **Syntax errors** must be fixed before a program can run, while **runtime errors** can be handled with try-except blocks.\n",
    "3. The `try` block contains code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "4. The `except` block contains code to handle specific exceptions.\n",
    "5. The `else` block executes if no exception occurs in the `try` block.\n",
    "6. The `pass` statement is a null operation that does nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Best Practices**\n",
    "1. **Be specific** in your exception handling: Catch specific exceptions rather than using a broad except clause.\n",
    "2. **Don't suppress exceptions** without reason: Only use `pass` if you have a good reason to ignore an exception.\n",
    "3. **Use loops** with try-except to repeatedly prompt users until they provide valid input.\n",
    "4. **Create reusable functions** for common operations like getting validated user input.\n",
    "5. **Make functions flexible** by adding parameters for customizable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Applications in Economics**\n",
    "As an Economics graduate, you'll find exception handling particularly useful when:\n",
    "- Processing economic data from various sources with different formats\n",
    "- Building models that need to handle edge cases and unexpected inputs\n",
    "- Creating user interfaces for economic analysis tools\n",
    "- Working with financial data that might contain errors or missing values\n",
    "- Implementing robust economic simulations that can handle edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is a fundamental concept in programming that will make your code more robust, user-friendly, and professional. Keep practicing with these techniques, and you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient Python programmer!"
