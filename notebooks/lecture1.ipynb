    "\n",
    "Conditionals are statements that allow a program to execute different pieces of code based on whether a condition is true or false. They are the foundation of decision-making in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of conditionals as forks in the road - your program can take different paths depending on the conditions it encounters. This ability to make decisions is what makes computers so powerful and versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use several keywords to create conditional statements:\n",
    "- `if` - executes code if a condition is true\n",
    "- `elif` - short for \"else if\", checks another condition if the previous ones were false\n",
    "- `else` - executes code if all previous conditions were false\n",
    "- `match` - a newer pattern matching construct (Python 3.10+)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by exploring the comparison operators that help us create conditions."

    "### Problem 5: Meal Time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it's breakfast time (7:00-8:00), lunch time (12:00-13:00), or dinner time (18:00-19:00). If it's not time for a meal, don't output anything at all. Assume that the user's input will be formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. Include a function called `convert` that converts a time string to the corresponding number of hours as a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Use the `split()` method to separate hours and minutes\n",
    "- Convert minutes to a fraction of an hour (minutes / 60)\n",
    "- Use comparison operators to check if the time falls within any meal time range\n",
    "- Use if-elif-else to determine which meal it is (or if it's not a meal time)"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed this comprehensive introduction to conditionals in Python. You've learned about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparison operators for creating conditions\n",
    "- The `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for controlling program flow\n",
    "- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) for combining conditions\n",
    "- Boolean values and expressions\n",
    "- The modulo operator for checking patterns\n",
    "- Functions that return boolean values\n",
    "- The `match` statement for pattern matching (Python 3.10+)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Applications of Conditionals\n",
    "Conditionals are fundamental to economic modeling and analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Economic Policy Models:** Implementing rules like \"IF inflation > 5% THEN increase interest rates\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Financial Algorithms:** Creating trading strategies like \"IF price > moving_average AND volume > threshold THEN buy\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Economic Classifications:** Categorizing countries by development status or economies by growth patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluating loan eligibility based on multiple financial criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Analysis:** Filtering and processing economic data based on various conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals are a fundamental concept in programming that allow your programs to make decisions and respond differently to different inputs. Mastering them is essential for becoming a proficient programmer."
