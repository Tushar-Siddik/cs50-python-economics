    "In economics, you often need to:\n",
    "- **Process Large Datasets:** Analyze years of economic data or thousands of survey responses\n",
    "- **Run Simulations:** Model economic scenarios over multiple time periods\n",
    "- **Perform Iterative Calculations:** Compute compound interest, economic projections, or equilibrium prices\n",
    "- **Implement Algorithms:** Sort data, search for patterns, or optimize economic models\n",

    "## 1. Introduction to Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are programming constructs that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are essential for tasks that require repetition, such as processing items in a list, performing calculations multiple times, or waiting for a specific condition to be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two main types of loops:\n",
    "- `while` loops: Repeat as long as a condition is true\n",
    "- `for` loops: Iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Applications of Loops\n",
    "In economics, loops are used for:\n",
    "- **Time Series Analysis:** Processing economic data over multiple time periods\n",
    "- **Economic Forecasting:** Running models with different parameters\n",
    "- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Repeating random experiments to estimate outcomes\n",
    "- **Data Processing:** Cleaning and analyzing large economic datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that enable you to write efficient and concise code. Without loops, you would need to repeat code manually, which is impractical for large-scale tasks. Let's start by exploring the two main types of loops in Python."
